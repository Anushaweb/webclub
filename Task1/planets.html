        <h1>
            PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
        </h1>
        <h1>MERCURY</h1>
    <p>
        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. 
        It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered 
        surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere. 

    </p>
    <h1 style="bgcolor:white">venus</h1>
    <p>venus is the second planet from the Sun. 
        It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System,
         and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth
</p>
    <h1>EARTH</h1>
    <p>Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. 
        It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more.
         Earth is special because it is an ocean planet.</p>
    <h1>MARS</h1>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. 
        Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past</p>
    <h1>JUPITER</h1>
    <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system –
         more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
          Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.
    </p>
    <h1>SATURN</h1>
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system.
         Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
          Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. 
          Saturn also has dozens of moons.
    </p>
    <h1>URANUS</h1>
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system.
         It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope,
          Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought
           it was either a comet or a star.
    </p>
        <h1>NEPTURN</h1>
        <P>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus).
             Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core. 
             Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.
        </P>
